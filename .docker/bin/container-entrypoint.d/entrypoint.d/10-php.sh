# OPcache is shared by every pool of the container, so by every instance, each
# loading its own compiled container. Measured with two instances after warming
# both: the interned-strings buffer full (8 of 8 MB), past which each worker keeps
# its own copy of the strings, and the shared memory about half used (65 of
# 128 MB on the admin). Symfony recommends 16 MB of interned strings at least.
